# By default, the traefik ingress listens only on one IP (which I call the primary IP).
# To handle requests coming from two different lans, this bridge service is needed.
# The service ensures that requests to '1.2.3.240' (secondary IP) will reach the
# ingress container as if they were meant for the primary IP '1.3.4.5'.
# Please note that this service is transparent to the cluster, services and ingresses
# will behave as if only the primary IP is configured;
# this means that in fields such as 'field.cattle.io/publicEndpoints' only the primary
# IP will be configured!
# (1) Traffic coming to this service won't be load balanced between cluster nodes, it will
# reach serviceâ€™s pod(s) that are on the same node, check https://metallb.universe.tf/usage/.
