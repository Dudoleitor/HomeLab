#	As of 2.0.0, FreeRADIUS supports virtual hosts using the
#	"server" section, and configuration directives.
#
#	Virtual hosts should be put into the "sites-available"
#	directory.  Soft links should be created in the "sites-enabled"
#	directory to these files.  This is done in a normal installation.
#
#	If you are using 802.1X (EAP) authentication, please see also
#	the "inner-tunnel" virtual server.  You will likely have to edit
#	that, too, for authentication to work.
